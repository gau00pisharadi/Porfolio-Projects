## Website Traffic Analysis Data Project

The goal of this project is to understand this traffic better, in particular the volume and distribution of events, and to develop ideas how to increase the links' clickrates. We have to answer the following questions.

1. How many total pageview events did the links in the provided dataset receive in the full period, how many per day?
2. What about the other recorded events?
3. Which countries did the pageviews come from?
4. What was the overall click rate (clicks/pageviews)?
5. How does the clickrate distribute across different links?

The dataset was obtained from Stratascratch (https://platform.stratascratch.com/data-projects/website-traffic-analysis)
