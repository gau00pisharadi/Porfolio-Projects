# [Marketing Campaign Results](https://platform.stratascratch.com/data-projects/marketing-campaign-results)

## Assignment
Imagine that Freedom ran a recent marketing campaign to promote the value proposition of how the debt relief program helps people achieve financial freedom. Assume the cost of this campaign was $5 million. There are five months of data in the datasets provided. Letâ€™s say campaign took place over the course of the third month. You now want to show the marketing, sales and operations teams just how successful this campaign was.

Using the three datasets given:

1. Provide a quantitative assessment of whether the marketing campaign was successful. How and why did you choose your specific success metric(s)?
2. Based on the provided data, how would you recommend campaign strategy be adjusted in the future to improve performance?
3. How do you think campaign performance would have changed if we did not run the campaign in Month 3, but instead postponed it until month 6? Provide an incremental number versus your result in Question #1.
